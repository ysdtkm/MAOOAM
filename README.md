## Model description ##

The atmospheric component of the model is based on the papers of Charney and
Straus (1980), Reinhold and Pierrehumbert (1982) and  Cehelsky and Tung (1987),
all published in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences. The ocean component is
based on the papers of Pierini (2012), Barsugli and Battisti (1998). The
coupling between the two components includes wind forcings, radiative and heat
exchanges.

## Implementation notes ##

As the system of differential equations is at most bilinear in y[j] (j=1..n), y
being the array of variables, it can be expressed as a tensor contraction
(written using Einstein convention, i.e. indices that occur twice on one side
of an equation are summed over):

    dy  / dt =  T        y   y      (y  == 1)
      i          i,j,k    j   k       0

The tensor T that encodes the differential equations is composed so that:

* T[i][j][k] contains the contribution of dy[i]/dt proportional to y[j]*y[k].
* Furthermore, y[0] is always equal to 1, so that T[i][0][0] is the constant
  contribution to var dy[i]/dt.
* T[i][j][0] + T[i][0][j] is the contribution to  dy[i]/dt which is linear in
  y[j].

Ideally, the tensor is composed as an upper triangular matrix (in the last two
coordinates).
