## Installation ##

Unpack the archive in a folder. There is no compilation required to run the
model once you have LuaJIT. 

Installation instructions for LuaJIT can be found on the [LuaJIT
website](http://luajit.org/install.html). In short, you can install it with the
following commands (on Linux):

```
git clone http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git
cd luajit-2.0
make && sudo make install
```

##  Description of the files ##

The model tendencies are represented through a tensor called aotensor which
includes all the coefficients. This tensor is computed once at the program
initialization.

* maooam.lua : Main program.
* aotensor.lua : Tensor aotensor computation module.
* inprod_analytic.lua : Inner products computation module.
* restore.lua : Function to restore a previous model state.
* write_IC.lua : Function to write an initial condition template.
* array.lua : Module for arrays and their mathematical operations.
* rk2.lua : Module with the Heun (second order Runge-Kutta) ODE integrator.
* rk4.lua : Module with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator.
* tensor.lua : Sparse tensor tools.
* gz.lua : Module with basic bindings to zlib.
* stat.lua : A module for statistic accumulation.
* maooam_tl_ad.lua : Module which defines the Tangent Linear and Adjoint models.
* README.txt : The present file.
* LICENSE.txt : The license text of the program.
* params.lua : A configuration file to specify the integration and model parameters.
* modeselection.lua : A configuration file to specify which spectral decomposition will be used.
* test_inprod_analytic.lua : Program to write out the inner products. For testing purposes.
* test_aotensor.lua : Program to write out the inner products. For testing purposes.
* test_tl_ad.lua : Program which tests the Tangent Linear and Adjoint models.

## Usage ##

Model and integration parameters can be specified in @{params|params.lua}.

The resolution of the model can be modified by specifying which modes should be
included in the file @{modeselection|modeselection.lua}.

The initial conditions for each of the variables are defined in IC.lua.
To obtain an example of this file corresponding to the model you have defined
in {modeselection|modeselection.lua}, simply delete the current IC.lua file (if
it exists) and run the program. It will generate a new one and exit. Just fill
the newly generated one.

This version is parallellized for MPI, using the
[lua-mpi](https://colberg.org/lua-mpi/) module.

To run a simulation, just run, e.g.
    mpirun -n 2 luajit maooam.lua

where 'mpirun -n 2' should be replaced by the MPI run command available at
your system.

This will generate several files:

* `output_maooam_meanfields.txt` : the @{stat|mean and variance} (climatology) of the variables
* `output_maooam_snapshot.txt` : snapshots of the dynamical state of the model
* `output_maooam_trajectory.txt_NNNN.gz` : the recorded time evolution of the
  variables (gzipped if compression is enabled).

To continue a previous run, use the "continue" argument:
    luajit maooam.lua continue

The tangent linear and adjoint models of MAOOAM are provided in
@{maooam_tl_ad|maooam_tl_ad.lua}.

## Implementation notes ##

As the system of differential equations is at most bilinear in y[j] (j=1..n), y
being the @{array} of variables, it can be expressed as a @{tensor} contraction
(written using Einstein convention, i.e. indices that occur twice on one side
of an equation are summed over):

    dy  / dt =  T        y   y      (y  == 1)
      i          i,j,k    j   k       0

The tensor T that encodes the differential equations is composed so that:

* T[i][j][k] contains the contribution of dy[i]/dt proportional to y[j]*y[k].
* Furthermore, y[0] is always equal to 1, so that T[i][0][0] is the constant
contribution to var dy[i]/dt.
* T[i][j][0] + T[i][0][j] is the contribution to  dy[i]/dt which is linear in
y[j].

Ideally, the tensor is composed as an upper triangular matrix (in the last two
coordinates).

The tensor for this model is composed in @{aotensor|aotensor.lua} and uses the
inner products defined in @{inprod_analytic|inprod_analytic.lua}.
